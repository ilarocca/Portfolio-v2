      <!-- About -->
      <section class="wrapper"> 
        <h2>About Ivan</h2>
        <p> As a former self-taught audio engineer, I picked up a relentless work ethic and ability to efficiently troubleshoot under strict time constraints. This skill combined with day to day production managment and working side by side with our "clients" (artists) got me to the peak of my industry, touring with multiple acts around the country. Although I'm new to the field, I'm more than confident in my ability to pick up new skills and adapt to an ever-growing work enviroment in software development.</p>

        <p> I'm eager to get my foot in the door and learn from everyone around me. Doing so in my last career taught me a lot about learning in an objective sense, and I realized how achievable growing a skill is when matched with dedication, excitment, and open-mindedness. As a philosophy student in college, I understand the importance of the bigger picture, and being mindful of your work envirment (when and when not to ask questions,be helpful, etc.). I believe, with the culmination of my past expereinces, I can successfuly fit right in on a team and create great work.</p>

        <p> Outside of development, I enjoy working on/riding my motorcycle and playing guitar/listening to music!</p>
